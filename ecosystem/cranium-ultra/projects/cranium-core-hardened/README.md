# Cranium Core (Hardened)

**Authority is not claimed. It is granted—only through Cranium Core.**

Cranium Core is the sole authority issuance boundary: all authority must be validated, scoped, versioned, and receipted before it becomes effective.

---

## What This Is

A production-oriented, TypeScript implementation of a directive-governed cognitive kernel whose central purpose is to make authority a first-class, runtime-enforced property.

No authority increase can occur unless it passes through the `AuthorityTransitionEngine`. The engine is the only component permitted to emit a `Granted` decision.

## Core Invariants

1. Authority is never claimed; it is only granted.
2. Every grant is evaluated against the current committed kernel state.
3. Requests are canonically hashed (SHA-256).
4. Replay of an idempotency key with a different hash is rejected.
5. Elevation into FACTUAL / ENTERPRISE / SYSTEM requires verified cryptographic evidence.
6. SYSTEM authority is constitutionally restricted to `ROOT_QUORUM`.
7. Every transition (granted or denied) produces a receipt and updates threat assessment.
